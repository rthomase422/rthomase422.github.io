Hi y'all! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research focuses on applied cryptography and human-centered privacy and security. I am advised by Prof. [Gabriel Kaptchuk](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/kaptchuk/) and Prof. [Ian Miers](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~imiers/).

Previously, I received both my Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I was advised by Prof. [Saba Eskandarian](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~saba/) and Prof. [Andrew Kwong](https://andrewkwong.org).

Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
